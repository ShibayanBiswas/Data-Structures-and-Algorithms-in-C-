01. DP Array Initialization: Initialize a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp[c]`, where `c` represents the column index. This array will store the maximum score that can be achieved up to the current row by selecting the cell in column `c` of that row.

02. Row Transition Logic: For each row in the matrix, compute the maximum possible points for each column by evaluating two scenarios:
   - Moving from left to right: Use a `leftMax` array to track the highest values from previous columns while considering penalties for moving leftward.
   - Moving from right to left: Similarly, use a `rightMax` array to track the highest values from the opposite direction while accounting for penalties for moving rightward.

03. DP Array Update: Update the DP array for the current row by comparing the values from the `leftMax` and `rightMax` arrays and adjusting for penalties. This ensures that the DP array reflects the maximum possible score for each column in the current row.

Time Complexity: O(m Ã— n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. The algorithm processes each cell only once.

Space Complexity: O(n), as only a single row of the DP array is maintained at any given time.
