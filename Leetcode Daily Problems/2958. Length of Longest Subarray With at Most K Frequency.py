"""
01. Initialize Variables: 
   - `freq`: A dictionary to store the frequency of elements in the current subarray.
   - `n`: The length of the input array `nums`.
   - `ans`: To store the maximum length of a good subarray found so far.
   - `i` and `j`: Two pointers representing the sliding window boundaries.

02. Traverse the Array with Sliding Window: 
   - Expand the window by moving the `j` pointer and update the frequency of the current element in `freq`.
   - If the frequency of the current element exceeds `k`, shrink the window by moving the `i` pointer and adjust the frequency of the elements accordingly until the subarray becomes good again (i.e., all frequencies are less than or equal to `k`).

03. Update the Maximum Length: For every valid subarray (where all element frequencies are â‰¤ `k`), update `ans` with the maximum length of the subarray.

04. Return the Result: After traversing the entire array, return `ans`, which contains the length of the longest good subarray.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array. The sliding window ensures that each element is processed at most twice.
Space Complexity: O(n) due to the additional space used for the `freq` dictionary to store element frequencies.
